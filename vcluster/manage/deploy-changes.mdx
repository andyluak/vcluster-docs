You can always introduce or update your `vcluster.yaml` and deploy new configuration options.

The vCluster control plane pod is going to be re-deployed.

<p></p>

:::warning Limitations on changing configuration
You cannot change distros or backing store once a virtual cluster is deployed, with one exception: starting with vCluster 0.25.0, migration from k3s to k8s distro is supported. See [k3s to k8s Migration](/vcluster/deploy/upgrade/distro-migration.mdx) for details.
